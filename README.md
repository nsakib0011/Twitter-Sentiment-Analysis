# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

A NLP based project where labeled data is classified to detect a particular sentiment; positive or negative. All the twitter data from the dataset, has been cleaned and tokenized so that it can be appropriate for training model. A naive bayes classifier has been used to train the model which I later tried on test data. After fitting the model to test data set, I got accuracy of 74%. A lot to work on and different classifiers to try. However, I am satisfied with the result as a neophyte.
